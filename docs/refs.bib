    abstract = "{A computer program called IMD is described. IMD is used for modeling the optical properties (reflectance, transmittance, electric-field intensities, etc.) of multilayer films, i.e., films consisting of any number of layers of any thickness. IMD includes a full graphical user interface and affords modeling with up to eight simultaneous independent variables, as well as parameter estimation (including confidence interval generation) using nonlinear, least-squares curve fitting to user-supplied experimental optical data. The computation methods and user interface are described, and numerous examples are presented that illustrate some of IMD’s unique modeling, fitting, and visualization capabilities. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.}",

    abstract = {The primary interactions of low-energy x-rays within condensed matter, viz. photoabsorption and coherent scattering, have been described for photon energies outside the absorption threshold regions by using atomic scattering factors. The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.}

    abstract = "{A general theory is developed for the scattering of x rays from a single nonideal interface between two dielectric media. It is then extended to describe the scattering of x rays from a multilayer structure composed of many nonideal interfaces. The most unique feature of this theory is that there are no constraints on the physical structure of the interfaces; the interfaces can have any form of roughness or compositional inhomogeneity. A simple analytical expression is derived for both the near and far radiation field to first order, assuming that the scattering is weak. The theory is valid for arbitrary polarization and at all angles of incidence (measured from the normal) less than the critical angle for total external reflection. Finally, the results are applied to study the effect of different interface structures on the performance of multilayer x‐ray optics.}",

    abstract = {We report quantum efficiency measurements of backilluminated, ion-implanted, laser-annealed CCD's in the wavelength range 13--10,000 {\AA}. The equivalent quantum efficiency (the equivalent photons detected per incident photon) ranges from a minimum of 5\% at 1216 {\AA} to a maximum of 87\% at 135 {\AA}. Using a simple relationship for the charge-collection efficiency of the CCD pixels as a function of depth, we present a semiempirical model with few parameters that reproduces our measurements with a fair degree of accuracy. The advantage of this model is that it can be used to predict CCD quantum efficiency performance for shallow backside implanted devices without a detailed solution of a system of differential equations, as in conventional approaches, and it yields a simple analytic form for the charge-collection efficiency that is adequate for detector calibration purposes. Making detailed assumptions about the dopant profile, we also solve the current density and continuity equations in order to relate our semiempirical model parameters to surface and bulk device properties. The latter procedure helps to better establish device processing parameters for a given level of CCD quantum efficiency performance.},
